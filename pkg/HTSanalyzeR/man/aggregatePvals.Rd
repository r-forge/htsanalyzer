\title{
Aggregates p values from gene set overrepresentation tests.
}
\description{
This function takes as input a matrix of p values for example obtained from a GSEA on multiple phenotypes, with a row for each gene set and a column for each phenotype and aggregates the p values by row (i.e. one aggregated p value for each gene set) according to Fisher or Stouffer's methods.
}
\usage{
aggregatePvals(pvalMatrix, method="fishers", pAdjustMethod="BH", order=TRUE)
}
\arguments{
  \item{pvalMatrix}{
a numeric matrix of p values, with rows named according to the gene set (rows correspond to gene sets, and columns to multiple p values to be aggregated for that gene set)
}
  \item{method}{
a single character value of "stouffers" or "fishers"
}
  \item{pAdjustMethod}{
a single character value specifying the p-value adjustment method to be used (see 'p.adjust' for details)
}
  \item{order}{
a single logical value: TRUE or FALSE. If it is TRUE, the results table will be ordered according to the aggregated p values.
}
}
\value{
a matrix with a row for each gene set and two columns: "Aggregated.p.value" and "Adjusted.aggregated.p.value"
}
\details{
The Fisher method combines the p values into an aggregated chi-squared statistic equal to -2.sum(log(Pk)) were we have k=1,..,K  pvalues independently distributed as uniform on the unit interval under the null hypothesis.  The resulting p values is calculated by comparing this chi squared statistic to a chi squared distribution with 2K degrees of freedom.
The Stouffer method computes a z statistic assuming that the sum of the quantiles (from a standard normal distribution) corresponding to the p values are distributed as N(0,K).
