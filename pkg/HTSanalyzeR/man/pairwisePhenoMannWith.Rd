\title{
Mann-Whitney test for shift in location of genes from gene sets on a pair of phenotypes
}
\description{
This function performs a Mann-Whitney test for shift in location of genes from gene sets, on a pair of phenotypes. It looks for gene sets that are represented towards the 2 different ends of two ranked lists of genes, i.e. whose phenotype distribution is located around two different values in the two phenotypes list, rather than spread on the whole list in both lists.
}
\usage{
pairwisePhenoMannWith(gl1, gl2, gsc, minGeneSetSize=15, pAdjustMethod="BH")
}
\arguments{
  \item{gl1}{
a named numeric or integer vector where names are gene identifiers of the same type as the ones in the gene set collection, and values are the measurement on phenotype 1 corresponding to those genes this vector MUST be ordered (decreasing or increasing)
}
  \item{gl2}{
a named numeric or integer vector where names are gene identifiers of the same type as the ones in the gene set collection, and values are the measurement on phenotype 2 corresponding to those genes this vector MUST be ordered
}
  \item{gsc}{
a list of gene sets. Each gene set in the list is a character vector. 
}
  \item{minGeneSetSize}{
a single numeric or integer value specifying the minimum size required for a gene set to be considered.
}
  \item{pAdjustMethod}{
a single character value specifying the p-value adjustment method to be used (see 'p.adjust' for details)
}
}
\value{
a table with a row for each gene set, containing the p value for the Mann-Whitney test, and the adjusted
p value.  The table is ordered by the p value column.
