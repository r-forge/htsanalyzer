#This function performs pairwise GSEA: it looks for gene sets that are specifically 
#overrepresented towards the 2 different ends of two ranked lists of genes,
#it takes as input:
	#-gl1: a named vector where names are gene identifiers of the same type as the ones in the 
#gene set collection, and values are the measurement on phenotype 1 corresponding to those genes
#this vector MUST be ordered (decreasing of increasing)
	#-gl2: a named vector where names are gene identifiers of the same type as the ones in the 
#gene set collection, and values are the measurement on phenotype 2 corresponding to those genes
#this vector MUST be ordered
#phenotypes 1 and 2 must be measured on the same genes, i.e. the two vectors must have the same
#length and their names must match, but the two vectors must be ordered separately, i.e.
#one phenotype vector is ordered based on the values of that phenotype only
	#-gsc: a gene set collection in geneSetCollection format (see the help on function collectionGsea)
	#-exponent: exponent for the GSEA, keep it at one (see the help on function collectionGsea)
	#-nperm: number of permutations for the GSEA (see the help on function collectionGsea)
	#-cutoff: minimum number of genes in one gene set (see the help on function collectionGsea)
	#-MHT: a method for multiple hypothesis testing correction (one of the p.adjust methods)
#it produces as output:	
#a table containing the p value for the GSEA, and the observed scores for each of the phenotypes
#independently.  The table is ordered by the p value column.
